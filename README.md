#Village Bot Lite

The lite version of http://villagebot.xyz/ still gives users AI generated village names, but it does so by drawing from a list of 60,000 pre-generated names, as opposed to letting users interact directly with the AI. This method is much cheaper (i.e. free, wheras running the AI on DigitalOcean was costing Â£20 a month) and for all intents and purposes, has the same result. The only downside is that users can no longer pass the bot a starting string. 

The source code and installation instructions for the full-blown AI are still available here: https://github.com/mattallinson/village-app
